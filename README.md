## Description

This Flutter project aims to explore the Canvas and CustomPainter classes to draw a simple smiley face. 

The project's primary goal is to demonstrate how to create custom UI elements by painting directly onto the canvas. It will showcase basic drawing operations like drawing circles (for the face and eyes) and arcs (for the mouth) using the CustomPainter API. 

This provides a foundation for more complex custom drawing and animations in Flutter.
